> Your favorite lists board!

I was feeling that there are no simple options for scratching a bunch of lists (daily tasks list, shopping list...), so here's Listify, **an easy to use board for lists**.

We all love lists, but where do you keep them? Maybe in WhatsApp or in a plain text file somewhere? Listify is **fully-featured** and aims to be **as convenient as your current solution**.

Access now: [listify.kauefraga.dev](https://listify.kauefraga.dev/)

- [x] Lists board
- [x] Create & remove lists
