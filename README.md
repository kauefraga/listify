> Your favorite list aggregator!

I was feeling that there are no options for simply scratching a list of daily tasks or a shopping list, so here's Listify, **an easy to use board for lists**.

We all love lists, but where do you keep them? Maybe in WhatsApp or in a plain text file somewhere? Listify is **fully-featured** and aims to be **as convenient as your current solution**.
